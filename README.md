# Hands-On Data Structures & Algorithms in Java 11 (V)
This is the code repository for [Hands-On Data Structures & Algorithms in Java 11 (V)](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/hands-data-structures-algorithms-java-11-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.

## About the Video Course
Programs are created from algorithms and data structures. Mastering these is an essential part of your development as a Java programmer. They are the main building blocks for each architectural pattern. Many tutorials treat data structures & algorithms as theoretical computer science topics. This course relates every technique back to real-world problems and situations you will face working as a programmer. The vision of the course is to get you acquainted with the core and advanced data structures and algorithms used for day-to-day applications. You’ll see how they work and how to use them effectively in your own programs. This course will be full of step-by-step instructions, revealing examples, and clear explanations that will help you understand the practical application of each algorithm with scenario trade-offs. You’ll learn to use querying binary search trees. The course will take you through heapsort, quicksort, recursion, and tail recursion algorithms. You’ll get familiar with multithreading and probabilistic algorithms. You’ll also understand the importance of advanced data structures and graph algorithms. This course will help you to gain in-demand knowledge of key data structures and algorithms and prepare you for the next stage in your career as a developer.
